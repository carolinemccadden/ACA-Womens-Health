"Notes"
"The majority of our health coverage topics are based on analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) by KFF. ACS includes a 1% sample of the US population and allows for precise state-level estimates.   "
""
"The ACS asks respondents about their health insurance coverage at the time of the survey. Respondents may report having more than one type of coverage; however, individuals are sorted into only one category of insurance coverage. See definitions for more detail on coverage type."
""
"Data may not sum to totals due to rounding."

"Sources"
"KFF estimates based on the 2008-2019 American Community Survey, 1-Year Estimates."

"Definitions"
"The ACS asks respondents about their health insurance coverage throughout the previous calendar year. Respondents may report having more than one type of coverage. In this analysis, individuals are sorted into only one category of insurance coverage using the following hierarchy:"
""
"*Medicaid*: Includes those covered by Medicaid, Medical Assistance, Children's Health Insurance Plan (CHIP) or any kind of government-assistance plan for those with low incomes or a disability, as well as those who have both Medicaid and another type of coverage, such as dual eligibles who are also covered by Medicare."
""
"*Employer*: Includes those covered by employer-sponsored coverage either through their own job or as a dependent in the same household."
""
"*Medicare*: Includes those covered by Medicare, except dual eligibles who are covered by both Medicaid and Medicare and those covered by Medicare and employer-sponsored insurance who work full-time."
""
"*Military*:  Includes those covered under the military or Veterans Administration."
""
"*Non-Group*: Includes individuals and families that purchased or are covered as a dependent by non-group insurance."
""
"*Uninsured*: Includes those without health insurance and those who have coverage under the Indian Health Service only."
""
"*N/A*: Estimates with relative standard errors greater than 30% are not provided."
